[css3-conditional] Add note explaining that user preferences that effectively disable a property (e.g., high-contrast mode disabling colors) do not effect the definition of support.

This addresses issue 3 in the last call disposition of comments,
which the working group rejected with no change other than adding this note.

The issue was raised in:

 <p>A CSS processor is considered to <dfn id="dfn-support">support</dfn>

+For example, if a user has enabled a high-contrast mode

 <p>These rules (and the equivalence between them) allow
 authors to use fallback (either in the [[CSS1]] sense of declarations
 that are overridden by later declarations or with the new capabilities
 provided by the ''@supports'' rule in this specification) that works
 correctly for the features implemented.  This applies especially to
 compound values; implementations must implement all parts of the value
 in order to consider the declaration supported, either inside a ruleset
 or in the declaration condition of an ''@supports'' rule.</p>
