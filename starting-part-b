as resolved in

   <li>Fixed missed substitution (<span>TransitionEventInit</span> rather than AnimationEventInit) when copying event IDL from css3-animations.
   <li>Make naming of event constructor dictionary parameters more consistent with DOM-Level-3-Events.
   <li>Make the behavior of simultaneous changes of 'transition-*' properties and transitionable properties even clearer.
   <li>Computed Value line for shorthands should say "see individual properties".
   <li>Define initial values of event properties,  using initializers in <span>TransitionEventInit</span>.
   <li>Define the model for starting of transitions and their interaction with other animations more precisely:
     <ul>
       <li>Define the <span>before-change style</span> and <span>after-change style</span> used for the style comparison, using the new concept of a <span>style change event</span>.
